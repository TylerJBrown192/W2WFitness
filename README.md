# W2W Fitness

Note to folks who are (rightly) disgusted by the fact that I am making commits directly to `master`: Github only counts main-branch commits to a dev's profile calendar graph.

In a perfect world, I would be following the [Scaled Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/#scaled-trunk-based-development) model of `git` commits and merges, likely with a `git merge --squash` policy requirement on all PRs coming into `master`. But, this policy would make it seem like I commit once per month, so here we are ðŸ¤£.

## Project-wide TODOs

* Install `eslint` and `tslint` for both sides of project
* Isolate `.vscode` and `nodemon` definitions for reuse
* Detail necessary software
* Detail install steps
* Detail run steps
