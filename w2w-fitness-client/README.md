# TODO

* Research better Router structure
  * I dislike having nested Route Switches in different components, e.g. Terminology.tsx
* Research better API request class structure (since Axios seems to be dead? ğŸ˜­) and `fetch` can be fairly basic / boilerplate heavy at times
* Move over to Sass
* Determine width breakpoints for app (does material-ui have these built in, like Bootstrap did?)
